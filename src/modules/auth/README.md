## Auth Module (WIP)
The auth module provides the basis for authentication and authorization in the entire application. The
two concepts will be documented separately.

Of note, however, is the fact that most of this is geared towards handling requests, this 
will be documented separately.

### Testing

All tests for this module live under the `_spec` folder. Additional description on how
to setup the tests will be added here.

### Methods
`getRoles()`

**returns**: `IRole`

Static method that returns the roles object.
